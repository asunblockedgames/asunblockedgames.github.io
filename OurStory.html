  <p class="story-text">Our story begins on September 26, 2024 when <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/CupSponge_1234/" target="_blank">CupSponge_1234</a> founded the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/saman-unblocked-games/home" target="_blank">Saman Unblocked Games google site</a>. It was revealed to people on September 27, 2024. During October 2024, he hired <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkuMZoy70zWuvFE67WZLllg" target="_blank">turboguff</a> and <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Epohthetotem46/" target="_blank">EpohtheTotem46</a>. But then Suddenly,
in November 2024, <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/CupSponge_1234/" target="_blank">CupSponge_1234</a> school had a google lockdown. And there was a new competitor called Unblocked Linkz. The google lockdown kinda made websites outside of the school not work. So <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/CupSponge_1234/" target="_blank">CupSponge_1234</a>  had to do something. So then he decided to make it out of Github.
On December 9, 2024, the <a href="https://samanunblockedgames.github.io/" target="_blank"> first github version</a> (no longer active unfortunately) for Saman Unblocked Games was released. So then this version even got more popular and people liked it even more. And on January 6, 2025, the name of this website change to AS Unblocked Games. But then Unblocked Linkz was also trying to compete too. The good thing was that a friend of <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/CupSponge_1234/" target="_blank">CupSponge_1234</a> (name was <a href="https://github.com/Redfoxplayz/RedFoxPlayz" target="_blank">RedFoxPlayz</a>  ) had acess to Unblocked Linkz, so in January and Febuary of 2025, they demolished Unblocked Linkz and it never came back.
 The bad news was on March 1 2025, <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/CupSponge_1234/" target="_blank">CupSponge_1234</a> found out that his website got deleted by Github. And why you ask? His employee <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Epohthetotem46/" target="_blank">EpohtheTotem46</a> added copyrighted things into the website so it got shut down by github. <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/CupSponge_1234/" target="_blank">CupSponge_1234</a> was furious. But he decided to give his employee one last chance. So this is what he did:
 After a lot of planning and solution, on March 18, 2025, he and his employees made new accounts, a new repository, and transfered all the code to get this website here. And that's where we are today. Hopefully you enjoy the games on this website. On April 2, 2025, <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Epohthetotem46/" target="_blank">EpohtheTotem46</a> just quit because he was busy. On April 24, <a href="https://github.com/Xentacz" target="_blank">Xentacz</a> was hired. </p>
